# mygymlogs

This is a pet project that I have always wanted to work on, so I finally decided to give it a go.

## Project Overview

The aim is very simple: to create a web application that works nicely on both desktop and mobile that has two main functionalities.

- Workout Logging: Register my gym workouts with a high level of customizability and store them in a cloud database.
- Progress Tracking: Query the data to generate insightful graphs and indicators that help track my progress.

There are many extra stuff that I dream of, but these are the core features that will be implemented for now. :)

## Tech Stack

This project is an opportunity to explore different technologies from what I currently work with. The goal is to build the entire application using Python as the backbone, with Streamlit for the web interface while connecting to cloud-based databases.
